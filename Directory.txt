Steps 

Creating the Dataset
1. Use API to call 2018 block level data for MD, VA, and DC from the acs on a variety of demographic, community, and housing factors (get_acs_data)
2. Use Census 2018 shape files to identify block groups of interest within DMV area (get_select_block_groups)
3. Filter called acs data by the block groups selected (filter_acs_data)
4. Download and parse Eviction Lab Data for MD, VA, and DV (2018), including creating a target variable (get_evictionlab_dmv)
5. Merge the filtered acs data with eviction lab data to get the working data set (merge_evictionlab_acs_dmv)
