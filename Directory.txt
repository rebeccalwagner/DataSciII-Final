filter_acs_data - filter acs datasets for all block groups in DMV to just block groups identified in DC MSA
get_acs_data - identify set of variables to call and grab them for all block groups in the DMV 
get_evictionlab_dmv - filter only DMV data from the original eviction lab data file and create target measure
get_select_block_groups - identify set of block groups to work with central to the DC MSA
merge_eviction_lab_acs_dmv - join the block group data from acs with the created target from EvictionLab 

Steps 

Creating the Dataset
1. Use API to call 2018 block level data for MD, VA, and DC from the acs on a variety of demographic, community, and housing factors 
    File: get_acs_data
    Input: compiled_acs_vars
    Output: acs5_2018_selected_vars_MD, acs5_2018_selected_vars_DC, acs5_2018_selected_vars_VA
2. Use Census 2018 shape files to identify block groups of interest within DMV area
    File: get_select_block_groups
    Input: tl_2010_51_bg10, tl_2010_24_bg10, tl_2010_11_bg10, tl_2020_us_county
    Output: SELECTED_DMV_BG
3. Filter called acs data by the block groups selected 
    File: filter_acs_data
    Input: SELECTED_DMV_BG, acs5_2018_selected_vars_DC, acs5_2018_selected_vars_MD, acs5_2018_selected_vars_VA
    Output: acs5_2018_selected_vars_DMV
4. Download and parse Eviction Lab Data for MD, VA, and DC (2018), specifically filing data
    File: get_evictionlab_dmv
    Input: bg_proprietary_2000_2018_v1.1
    Output: EvictionLab_bg_DMV, EvictionLab_bg_DMV_Filing
5. Merge the filtered acs data with eviction lab data to get the working data set 
    File: merge_eviction_lab_acs_dmv
    Input: acs5_2018_selected_vars_DMV, EvictionLab_bg_DMV_Filing
    Output: Filing_Dataset

Creating the Model
1. Preprocess the finalized dataset 
    File: preprocessing
    Input: Filing_Dataset
    Output: Filing_Dataset_Imputed
2. Train the Model 
    File: classification_v1
    Input: Filing_Dataset_Imputed
